## About The Project
Mental health issues have become an important issue today. Many cases of mental health disorders have resulted in suicide. Therefore, it is very important to detect mental health problems early on, so that they can be treated appropriately. From our research, based on journals, papers, and even existing applications, mental health detection is still limited, especially in Indonesia. So, we decided to choose this project theme to help increase awareness of mental health among the Indonesian public and assist in the early detection of mental health problems.
